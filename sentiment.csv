On my tippy toes
So that he won't know

I was raised off of rural route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
And race barefoot back to Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned the corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road.

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)

He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out

Talking black, brainwashed from rock and rap

It was all good at first, spendin' money, goin' shoppin'
Eatin' at the finest restaurants and if I'm club hoppin'
She was right thurr wit me, bottle poppin', livin' that life
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I ain't like

We didn't have a worry in the world, gotcha diamonds, gotcha pearls
But I can't help it if Chinga-ling be attractin' all the girls
Say what? Baby, I'ma superstar and that come wit it
Gotta good nigga on your side, you betta run wit it

Even though I'm on the road doin' shows
I made time for me and hurr, relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me

'Cuz when I'm outta town, always think of hurr
Might conversate wit some chicks but no one come above hurr

You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
